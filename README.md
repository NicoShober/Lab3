1.) in code

2.)You can check overflow when the new value is less than the previous value using an if statement.

3.)The 256th term caused overflow

4.)YOu can check if there is overlflow the same way as in problem 2. The 17th value gives overflow.

5.) the 171st value prompts overflow

6.)The values are different because each time the code runs the process 1/n, the less precisce data type
  will skew further and further from the actual answer.
  
7.) the error is that it includes 4.4 in the red out but I hae no idea why

8.) switching to double solves the issue from problem 7
